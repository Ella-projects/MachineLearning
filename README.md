## 💻 How to Run

### 1. **Testing the Pre-trained Model**

Get fast results by evaluating the pre-trained model:

```bash
python IMLO_Test_File.py
```

This will output:
- **Model Accuracy** (as a percentage)
- **Average Loss** on the test dataset.

### 2. **Training a New Model**

Build and train the model from scratch to customize the architecture or improve the performance:

```bash
python Imlo2.py
```

This script handles both training and testing of the model, providing insights into the model’s performance and potential improvements.
