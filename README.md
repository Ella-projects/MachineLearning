# MachineLearning

For my individual IMLO project, please download the three necessary files: Imlo2.py, IMLO_Test_File.py, and Model.pt.

To evaluate the test results using the pretrained model, execute the IMLO_Test_File.py script. This will apply my model to the test dataset and output both the accuracy (as a percentage) and the average loss.

If you wish to train a model from the beginning, execute the Imlot2.py script. This will handle both the training and testing of the model.
