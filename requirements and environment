### Hardware Requirements
- **GPU Support**: The experiments have been optimized for high-performance computing environments using Google Colab's L4 and A100 GPUs. These GPUs significantly reduce computation times and are recommended for training and testing the model efficiently.

### Software Requirements
- **Python Version**: Python 3.7 or higher
- **Operating System**: Platform independent, but designed for use on Google Colab

### Python Packages
The following Python packages are required to execute the model scripts. These can be installed via pip or conda, and are also available by default in the Google Colab environment:

- `torch>=1.7.0`: For creating and training the neural network models.
- `torchvision>=0.8.0`: For data transformation and loading pretrained models relevant to computer vision tasks.
- `numpy>=1.19.2`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib>=3.3.2`: For plotting and visualizing data (optional, for analysis and inspection of results).

### Installation Commands
To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
